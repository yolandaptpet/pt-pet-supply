    Grooming services typically include a range of treatments to keep pets clean
    and healthy. <span class="font-bold">Full service baths</span>
    involve washing and conditioning the pet&#39;s coat, followed by drying.
    <span class="font-bold">Haircuts</span> are offered for pets needing a trim or
    specific grooming style. <span class="font-bold">Tidy-ups</span>
    focus on lighter grooming, such as trimming around the face, paws, or tail. <span
      class="font-bold">Nail trims</span
    > or <span class="font-bold">dremmeling</span> are done to maintain healthy nails,
    with dremmeling being a smoother, more rounded alternative to traditional clipping.
    These services help maintain a petâ€™s hygiene, appearance, and comfort.
